## 📝 Project Overview

The **Public Transportation Analysis** dashboard provides valuable insights into the performance and utilization of city transit services. The primary goal is to enhance the **efficiency**, **coverage**, and **reliability** of public transportation systems using data-driven insights.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

- 📉 **Underperforming Routes**: Lack of optimization in certain bus lines.
- 🕒 **Service Delays**: Need to assess and reduce transit time and delays.
- 👥 **Ridership Patterns**: Insufficient understanding of peak usage and demographics.
- 📊 **Decision Support**: City planners need actionable insights for transit improvements.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🗺️ Improve route planning and reduce travel time.
- ⚙️ Enhance operational efficiency of city buses.
- 👤 Understand commuter behavior and demographic usage.
- 🧠 Support data-driven decision-making for public transport development.

## 🔧 Steps Followed

1. 📥 Imported 4 CSV datasets: `buses`, `demographics`, `modified_routes`, `ridership`.
2. 🔍 Used Power Query Editor features like **column distribution**, **quality**, and **profile**.
3. ✅ Enabled full dataset profiling for deeper insights.
4. 🕐 Fixed minor null values in the `Arrival time` column (less than 1%).
5. 🧮 Excluded blanks from average calculations automatically.
6. 🎨 Applied a consistent report theme in Power BI.
7. 📊 Built visuals to display metrics like peak hours, utilization, and trends.
8. 🎛️ Added interactive filters and slicers for exploration.
9. 🧼 Cleaned and transformed data before loading into Power BI model.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📈 Peak Hours and Utilization

- 🕘 **Peak hour**: 8:57 AM (morning rush).
- 🌙 **Lowest ridership**: 7:50 PM.
- 🚍 Bus utilization:
  - 36 properly utilized
  - 27 over-utilized
  - 19 under-utilized

### 👥 Ridership Trends

- 📅 Steady monthly increase from January to December.
- ⬇️ **Sharp decline** in ridership from **2023 (85.8%)** to **2024 (14.17%)**.

### 🛣️ Route & Demographics

- 🛤️ **East-West Express**: Busiest route.
- 🧭 **South Line**: Least utilized.
- 🧓 Demographic insights (age, gender, occupation) can help target specific rider segments.

### 🗓️ Day & Time Analysis

- 🚶‍♂️ Highest ridership: **Sundays and Mondays**
- 🕘 Peak rider activity: **9:00 AM – 11:59 AM**

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### 🚏 Optimize Bus Routes

- Increase frequency during peak (8:57 AM).
- Re-evaluate South Line for under-utilization and reallocation.

### 🛠️ Enhance Service Delivery

- Reassign buses from low-demand to high-demand routes.
- Improve scheduling around low-use periods like 7:50 PM.

### 📊 Focus on Ridership Trends

- Investigate the **2023–2024 drop** and address root causes.
- Use demographics to launch **targeted promotions**.

### ⏰ Adjust for Peak Times

- Add extra buses during **9 AM – 12 PM**.
- Ensure better service coverage on **Sundays and Mondays**.
