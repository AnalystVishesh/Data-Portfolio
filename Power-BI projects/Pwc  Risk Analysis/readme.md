## Project Overview

This project is part of a **virtual internship** organized by **PwC Switzerland** on the Forage platform. The goal is to build a customer retention dashboard for PhoneNow’s retention team. The dashboard aims to predict customers at risk of churn and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

---

## Problem Statement

PhoneNow faces high customer churn impacting revenue and growth. Current retention efforts are reactive and lack predictive capabilities. The challenge is to create a dashboard that:

- Identifies customers likely to terminate contracts
- Visualizes churn drivers clearly for management
- Enables proactive retention interventions

---

## Key Issues Addressed

- High costs of customer acquisition vs. retention
- Reactive rather than proactive retention strategies
- Insufficient predictive insights on churn risk
- Ineffective Excel-based analysis tools
- Need for intuitive, self-explanatory visualizations

---

## Project Goals

- Develop predictive insights to identify at-risk customers
- Visualize customer data and churn metrics clearly
- Support data-driven retention strategies
- Understand customer demographics and behaviors
- Replace Excel with interactive Power BI visualizations

---

## Data & Methodology

- **Data Sources**: Customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, service usage, support tickets, churn records
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats
- **Data Modeling**: Created relationships and calculated churn risk categories
- **Visualization**: Built interactive charts showing churn rates, risk categories, contract types, and customer loyalty

---

## Key Insights

- ~1,869 customers identified as at-risk with a potential revenue impact of $2.86 million annually
- Month-to-month contracts have higher churn than long-term contracts
- Customers using electronic checks show higher churn rates than those with automatic payments
- Fiber optic service users churn more compared to DSL or no service users
- High support ticket volume indicates potential dissatisfaction points
- Senior citizens and customers with partners/dependents form a significant at-risk segment
- Paperless billing adoption is high among at-risk customers, showing digital preferences

---

## Recommendations

- Implement targeted retention programs focusing on high-risk segments
- Introduce incentives for longer-term contracts
- Improve customer support and reduce ticket resolution times
- Streamline and promote convenient payment methods
- Investigate and address fiber optic service quality issues
- Tailor retention efforts to demographic needs (e.g., seniors)
- Enhance digital communication and billing platforms
- Continuously monitor churn metrics and adjust strategies
