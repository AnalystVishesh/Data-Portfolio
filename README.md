# üìä Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of my work in **Python**, **Power BI**, and **SQL**, showcasing real-world projects across data analysis, business intelligence, and automation.

Each project highlights my ability to extract insights, build visualizations, automate workflows, and communicate data-driven solutions.
